        "# The $n$-Queens puzzle: Introduction and overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The classic [eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) refers to the challenge of placing eight [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) [queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess)) on an $8 \\times 8$ board such that no queen is attacking any other.  Specifically, there can only be (at most) a single queen on any row, column, and diagonal of the board.  Here is one solution to the eight queens puzzle (there are 92 distinct solutions in total, or 12 if rotations and reflections are not counted as separate solutions):\n",
        "\n",
        "![8-queens](https://i.stack.imgur.com/D32OV.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "In principle, the eight queens puzzle may be generalized to imaginary chessboards of any size.  For $n \\geq 1$, placing $n$ queens on an $n \\times n$ chess board is referred to as the $n$-queens puzzle.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, you'll be building a solver for the $n$-queens puzzle.  There are two general functions you'll need to write:\n",
        "1. A function for printing out a board position (e.g., depicting the configuration of the pieces visually)\n",
        "2. A function for checking whether a given position corresponds to a solution (i.e., whether any queens are attacking each other)\n",
        "\n",
        "Using these two functions, you'll be provided with functions for returning all solutions (given $n \\geq 1$) and for returning the *number* of solutions (given $n \\geq 1$).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Some history of the $n$-queens puzzle\n",
        "In [a 2017 paper](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11079), the $n$-queens puzzle (sometimes called the $n$-queens problem) was shown to be a member of a set of problems in computer science that are [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness).  Exploring or proving NP-completeness is beyond the scope of our course, but the super high-level intuition for NP-completeness can be summarized as:\n",
        "  - For all known ways of solving them, NP-complete problems take a very long time to solve (their associated computations don't scale well)\n",
        "  - Because all NP-complete problems can be efficiently(ish) converted to other NP-complete problems, solving any one NP-complete problem efficiently would also provide an efficient solution for *all* NP-complete problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solving NP-complete problems efficiently is an [open question in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem).  Although we won't be attempting to make a research breakthrough in this question space, it can still be fun and instructive to explore problems like the $n$-queens puzzle.\n",
        "\n",
        "# General (naïve-ish) solution\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we'll represent the board in an efficient way: an $n$-dimensional array, where the position reflects the column number and the value reflects the row of the queen at that column.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the above solution to the 8-queens puzzle could be represented by the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 1, 7, 5].\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that, with this notation, every possible solution to the $n$-queens puzzle must be a permutation of the integers from 0 to $n-1$. This ensures that at most a single queen is placed in each row and column.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next we need to check the diagonals. Using the same notation, we can check to see if queens are attacking each other along the \"forward\" (top-left to bottom-right) diagonal by asking whether any queens share the same difference between their row and column. In other words: if $r_0...(n-1)$ represents the queens' rows and $c_0...(n-1)$ represents the queens' columns, we must ensure that $r_i - c_i$ never equals $r_j - c_j$ for any value of $i$ not equal to $j$. This can be checked efficiently by ensuring that `len(np.unique(np.arange(n) - pos)) == n`. Finally, to check the \"reverse\" diagonal (i.e. top-right to bottom-left), we can use analogous logic and verify that `len(np.unique(np.arange(n-1, -1, -1) - pos)) == n` as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "If no queens share a row, column, forward diagonal, or reverse diagonal, and if $n$ queens have been placed on the $n \\times n$ board, then we have found a solution!\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïvely, to find every solution of the $n$-queens puzzle for a given $n$, we could simply iterate through all possible permutations of the integers from $0...(n-1)$, check whether each is a valid solution, and collect up all of the permutations that are valid solutions. The challenge is that the number of permutations of $n$ numbers is $n$ factorial, which becomes intractable as $n$ gets large. For example, storing a single integer in short (16 bit) format requires 2 bytes. Therefore storing a single position (of length $n$) requires $2n$ bytes. Storing all possible $n!$ permutations for a $13 \\times 13$ board would require over 12GB of memory, and for a $14 \\times 14$ board would require over 174GB!\n",
        "\n",
        "Since our main concern for this assignment is to improve our programming skills, we won't worry about scalability here; you can assume that you'll never need to solve (or count solutions for) $n > 12$.\n",
        "\n",
